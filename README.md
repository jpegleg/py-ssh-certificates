# Python OpenSSH Certificates
A small and simple implementation of OpenSSH Certificates in Python.

# Credit
Some functions (first part of sshcert_utils.py) are borrowed from the Paramiko library, since I couldn't figure out how to properly deflate a long integer to a bytestring and still conform to the OpenSSH Certificate format. <br>
Maybe I'll figure it out some day.
